# AccessAlly-Assesment
Please find attached the solutions for the two problems in the coding assessment for AccessAlly 
It was solved in Python taking command line input from user, with the option of reading a file as commented out code

#### ** Problem 1: Finding Favourite Times **
Enter an integer in the terminal
Sample input:
```
420
```
Alternatively, you can find a few lines of commented code at the top of the file, which reads text files. Simply uncomment and edit the file name


#### ** Problem 2: Blood Distribution ** 
When prompted by the message in the terminal, enter a set of 8 integers for each input (1st set for the blood available and 2nd set for patients)
Make sure to leave exactly one space between each number
Note that the blood types are in the following order as per the problem description: *O- O+ A- A+ B- B+ AB- AB+*
Sample input:
```
Enter blood supply list (single space between numbers): 5 5 3 1 2 11 5 12
Enter patient list (single space between numbers): 2 4 9 2 3 9 7 3
```
Alternatively, you can find a few lines of commented code at the top of the file, which reads text files. Simply uncomment and edit the file name

Both solutions have been put through all the test cases.
